2. Why is writing use cases iterative?
   - Writing use cases is iterative because they evolve as more details are discovered and clarified. The initial use cases provide a starting point, but as development progresses, more precise scenarios and interactions are added or refined.

3.explain actor, goal, and scenario?
   *actor-  an entity that interacts with the system, which could be a user, another system, or a hardware device.
   *Goal-the objective or outcome that an actor aims to achieve through their interaction with the system.
   *Scenario- A sequence of actions or events that occur during the interaction between an actor and the system to achieve a specific goal.

4.what are the classifications of objects discovered via textual analysis?
   - Objects discovered via textual analysis are typically classified into three categories: 
     *Boundary Objects: Interfaces that handle interactions between the system and actors.
     *Entity Objects: objects that represent data or domain concepts within the system.
     *Control Objects  Objects that manage the flow of the system’s operations and control the interaction between boundary and entity objects.
